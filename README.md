Readability Score
=====================
Four algorithms can be used to calculate readability in this program:  

1.  Automated readability index (ARI)

2.  Flesch–Kincaid readability tests (FK)

3.  Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG)

4.  Coleman–Liau index (CL)

The application is launched with one argument - the path to the file to parse the text.
